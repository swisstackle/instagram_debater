# General Fitness Guidelines

Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health. Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do everyday activities.

## Benefits of Regular Exercise

Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain some health benefits. Only a few lifestyle choices have as large an impact on your health as physical activity.

Everyone can experience the health benefits of physical activity – age, abilities, ethnicity, shape, or size do not matter.

## Getting Started

If you're not active now, starting any amount of physical activity can begin to deliver health benefits. Even small amounts of physical activity are better than none at all. The more physical activity you do, the greater the health benefits.

## Types of Physical Activity

Physical activity includes all movement that increases energy use, whereas exercise is planned, structured physical activity. Both are beneficial to your health.

## Recommendations

Adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week. This can be broken down into shorter sessions throughout the week. Additionally, muscle-strengthening activities should be performed on 2 or more days per week.

## Conclusion

The key message is simple: moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can.
